# NASA-Near-Earth-Object-NEO-Tracking-Insights-Using-Public-API-
Developed an interactive web application to analyze NASAâ€™s asteroid dataset, enabling users to query and  visualize Near-Earth Object (NEO) data efficiently. 
# ðŸš€ NASA Asteroid Data Collector

This Python project fetches Near Earth Object (NEO) data from NASA's public API and stores it in a MySQL database. The dataset includes details such as asteroid names, estimated diameters, magnitude, and whether they are potentially hazardous.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Connects to the [NASA NEO API](https://api.nasa.gov/)
- Fetches asteroid data within a given date range
- Parses relevant information such as:
  - Name
  - Absolute Magnitude
  - Estimated Diameter (min and max)
  - Hazardous status
- Stores the extracted data into a MySQL database table
- Ensures table is created only if it doesn't already exist
